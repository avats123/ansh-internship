# FHIR Data Analysis - Basic Questions

This repository contains synthetic healthcare data in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. The data appears to be generated using [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea), an open-source synthetic patient generator.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Files**: 1,133 FHIR JSON bundles
- **Data Source**: Synthea synthetic patient generator
- **Format**: FHIR R4 Bundle resources

## FHIR Resource Types Present

Based on analysis of the sample data, this dataset contains the following FHIR resource types:

### Core Resources
- **Patient** - Demographics and basic patient information
- **Encounter** - Healthcare visits and interactions
- **Condition** - Medical conditions and diagnoses
- **Observation** - Clinical measurements and assessments
- **Procedure** - Medical procedures performed
- **MedicationRequest** - Prescriptions and medication orders

### Administrative Resources
- **Coverage** - Insurance coverage information
- **Claim** - Healthcare billing claims
- **ExplanationOfBenefit** - Insurance claim adjudications
- **ServiceRequest** - Orders for services
- **CareTeam** - Healthcare team members
- **CarePlan** - Treatment plans

### Clinical Resources
- **DiagnosticReport** - Test results and reports
- **DocumentReference** - Clinical documents
- **Immunization** - Vaccination records
- **Device** - Medical devices
- **SupplyDelivery** - Medical supply deliveries

## Basic Analysis Questions

### 1. Patient Demographics
- How many unique patients are in the dataset?
- What is the age distribution of patients?
- What is the gender distribution?
- What are the most common race/ethnicity categories?
- What geographical areas do patients come from?

### 2. Clinical Conditions
- What are the most common medical conditions?
- What is the prevalence of chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, etc.)?
- How are conditions distributed across different age groups?
- What are the most frequent diagnosis codes (ICD-10)?

### 3. Healthcare Utilization
- What is the average number of encounters per patient?
- What are the most common types of healthcare encounters?
- What is the distribution of encounter duration?
- Which healthcare facilities are most frequently visited?

### 4. Medications
- What are the most commonly prescribed medications?
- What is the average number of medications per patient?
- Which medication categories are most prevalent?
- How do medication patterns vary by age and condition?

### 5. Procedures and Tests
- What are the most frequently performed procedures?
- What diagnostic tests are most commonly ordered?
- How do procedure patterns correlate with conditions?
- What is the distribution of procedure costs?

### 6. Clinical Measurements
- What vital signs are most frequently recorded?
- What are the normal ranges for common lab values?
- How do clinical measurements vary by patient demographics?
- Which biomarkers are most commonly tracked?

### 7. Healthcare Costs
- What is the average cost per encounter?
- Which conditions are associated with highest costs?
- How do costs vary by procedure type?
- What is the distribution of insurance coverage?

### 8. Care Coordination
- How many patients have care teams?
- What is the average size of care teams?
- Which specialties are most commonly involved?
- How do care plans correlate with patient outcomes?

### 9. Data Quality
- Are there any missing or incomplete records?
- What is the date range of the data?
- How consistent are the coding systems used?
- Are there any data validation issues?

### 10. Population Health
- What are the most common health screening patterns?
- How do immunization rates compare to guidelines?
- What preventive care measures are documented?
- Are there any population health trends visible?

## Getting Started with Analysis

To begin analyzing this FHIR data:

1. **Load the data**: Parse the JSON bundles to extract individual resources
2. **Normalize the structure**: Convert FHIR resources to tabular format for analysis
3. **Clean the data**: Handle missing values and standardize codes
4. **Create patient timelines**: Link resources by patient ID to understand care journeys
5. **Apply analytics**: Use the questions above as starting points for investigation

## Tools and Libraries

Consider using these tools for FHIR data analysis:
- **Python**: `fhir-parser`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **R**: `fhircrackr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`
- **SQL**: Load into database for complex queries
- **FHIR servers**: HAPI FHIR for advanced querying capabilities

## Data Privacy Note

This dataset contains synthetic patient data generated for educational and research purposes. No real patient information is included, making it safe for analysis and sharing while maintaining realistic clinical patterns.
